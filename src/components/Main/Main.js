              <p className="where-use__description">If you want to study Computer Science at Oxford, then it is long and
                expensive.
                But in the modern world there are projects that allow you to get knowledge at a decent level. Surely, at
                a sufficient level for your employment in a sustainable company, where you will have a good salary.
                Or, having sufficient knowledge, you can develop your own business project.</p>
              <p className="where-use__description">If it doesnâ€™t matter to you that the building in which you study is
                not like
                Hogwarts, and if you do not
                want to leave your relatives and friends for years, then you can study from home or from any place where
                there is Internet and your device with Internet (laptop or smartphone). You do not have to spend tens or
                even hundreds of thousands of dollars to study at the university. You can get the necessary knowledge
                from
                the field of Computer Science for a lower budget. Moreover, you now have the opportunity to demand your
                desired price for a particular course. For example, if you want to take an introductory IT course, then
                this
                can be an absolutely reasonable price. Or, if you want to study web development in more depth, it can
                cost
                more, but still not tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
                Nowadays, any person from any city in the world has the opportunity to remotely study on a convenient
                schedule in a short time at an affordable price.</p>
